# Test and Integration Plan
## 10.1 Unit Test Plan
The test and integration plan provides an overview of the testing framework and specific tests that will be used to assess the functionality of our application.  Since the desired outputs for front-end and back-end components are known, a white-box approach will dictate the data that the tests leverage.  React Native is an extension of Javascript, so the time-proven [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) will be used in combination with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) in order to assess correct implementation of components.
