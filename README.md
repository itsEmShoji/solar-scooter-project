# Solar Powered Electric Scooter Charging Station - MOBILE APPLICATION

## About The Project

Our team is creating a mobile application to support an initiative to install solar powered charging stations for electric scooters in Loyola Marymount University and Los Angeles. This project is in coordination with the City of Los Angeles, LMU Mechanical Engineering, LMU Electrical Engineering, LMU Entrepreneurship, and LMU Computer Science. 

### Phase 1 (Fall 2018)

The Software Team will be creating an application with React Native to track locations of the charging stations. Each charging station location will include specifics on the number of open charge slots and the number of charged scooters available. There will also be pages to view statistics on energy saved, and incentives and rewards to use the charging stations.
